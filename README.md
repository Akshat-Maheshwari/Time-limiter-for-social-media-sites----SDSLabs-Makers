## Editing
### (Feature of Editing time and adding more sites is under development)
Even then if you want to edit then in background.js there is an object called initialDates, edit/Add in the same schema and then just reload the extension.


## Improvement & Ideas 
- Add a feature to edit the time (Base is already created).
- Add a feature to add more websites (Base is already created).
- Improve the design.
- Improve the logic to reset after a day.
- Add logic to block some websites at certain time of day.
